AppLauncher
===========

An easy to use application launcher for Windows, very similar to the Chrome Canary Launcher with the ability to customize the applications that appear

Since Windows 8 doesn't have a start button yet, this seemed like it'd be helpful to me

Made with C# and WPF.

Work in progress, but here's what it currently looks like.

Only 4 shortcuts currently on, but each 'page' can hold 16.  The goal is to pin this to your taskbar.  The app will auto exit when it loses focus. (ie. you do anything)
Meant to be able to open and close quickly and easily as needed
